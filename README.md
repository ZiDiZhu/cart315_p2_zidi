questions:

1. How long did it take you to complete all levels? (1-4) 

2. Do you think it's intuitive enough to not need any text tutorials?

3. Any suggestions for mechanics? (i'm thinking multiple avatars with mirroring movements?)

4. Any suggestions for a theme/story for this puzzle game?

6. other thoughts / comments?
